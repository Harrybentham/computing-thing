Question 1
implementation 1 is a bubble sort algorithm. Over 10000 random numbers I found the average time to sort was 11650 milliseconds, averaging roughly 1.2 milliseconds per number. This is fairly inefficient.

implementation 2 however is a Selection sort algorithm.  Over 10000 random numbers I found the average time to sort was 3342 milliseconds, averaging roughly 0.3 milliseconds per number
This means implementation 2 was approximately 4 times more efficient than implementation 1

Question 2
The algorithm for implementation 1's best case is:
O(n)
The algorithm for implementation 1's worst case is:
O(n*n)

The algorithm for implementation 2's best case is:
O(n*n)
The algorithm for implementation 2's worst case is:
O(n*n)
